# 👋 Hello everyone 

## 💬 I'm Lucas and I'm a machine learning engineer 

I like to use Python 🐍 for personal and professional projects (but this is not my native language 😝).

###  Here is a quick list of my most recent or significant projects: 💻

- Just recently, I have create a small app to play with a buzzer 🚨 on each personal device. I developed it to try Flask API !
    You can find it here: [luk-f/BuzzerApp](https://github.com/luk-f/BuzzerApp)
- I'm currently work on a algorithm used to aggregate movement data (in 2D) and generalize spatial information: 
[luk-f/AggOfMassiveMvtData](https://github.com/luk-f/AggOfMassiveMvtData), 
     - and I've implemented a specific package with `pybind11` [luk-f/pyhaversine](https://github.com/luk-f/pyhaversine)
- And obviously, I should refer to my PhD work 🎓 that just finished last year, 
an unsupervised method of anomaly detection on multidimensional stream data (a CFOF approximation with *i*SAX tree):
[luk-f/pyCFOFiSAX](https://github.com/luk-f/pyCFOFiSAX)
- Also developed the CFOF method to compare it to my thesis work: [luk-f/pyCFOF](https://github.com/luk-f/pyCFOF)
